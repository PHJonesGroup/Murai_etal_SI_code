# p53mut_SB_dynamics
Deterministic analysis of the short-term p53 mutant population dynamics and early transformation hallmarks in the tissue structure and properties.
Run p53mut-SB-dynamics.m to show the expected transformation changes under different parameter conditions.

### Dependencies
- Competition-det-eq.m : contains the set of ODE to be integrated to resolve the dynamics

### Requirements
Matlab R2016b
